# Car Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project examines the `auto_mpg.csv` dataset to derive information regarding fuel efficiency and car characteristics. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Loads the dataset, manages missing values, and preprocesses the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, visualizations, and distribution plots.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforms categorical variables, scales numerical values, and manages outliers.
- **Data Visualization**: Applies Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent correlations, trends, and distributions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applies regression models to predict MPG from the given features.

## Dataset
The dataset `auto_mpg.csv` includes the following columns:
- `mpg`: Miles per gallon (target)
- `cylinders`: Number of car cylinders
- `displacement`: Engine displacement
- `horsepower`: Car horsepower
- `weight`: Vehicle weight
- `acceleration`: Acceleration time
- `model_year`: Manufacturing year
- `origin`: Region of origin

## Results
- Visualizations of fuel efficiency trends
- Feature importance analysis
- Regression model accuracy for MPG prediction
